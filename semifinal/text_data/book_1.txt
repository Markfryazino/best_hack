                             I WAS       still exhausted from the twenty-four-hour flight as the car
                                         driven by a family friend made its way through the cornfields
                             of southwestern Minnesota. It was the fall of 1982 and my second day
                             in the United States. Lost in numbed thought, I was beginning to fully
                             understand that I was alone and for the first time away from my famil-
                             iar life in Mumbai. Panic washed over me as the white station wagon
                             approached the small town of Marshall, and the four-story buildings of
                             the university campus towered above the flat fields. What was I doing
                             here? What was I going to do for meals? My dormitory arrangements




                                                                                                                                                         TJ181-2-2013 IMUS 7/WPX0349-Indian Cooking Unfolded W:8.625”xH:8.625” 150L 120gsm Golden Sun W/F Magenta
                             did not include a meal plan. It quickly became obvious to me that this
                             town would not have restaurants that served the food I was accustomed
                             to, especially since I was, like many Indians, a sucker for spice. Why
                             hadn’t I heeded my sister’s advice to learn at least the basics of cooking
                             my childhood favorites?

                            rice. Gently rub the slender grains of rice

                            breaking them, to wash off any dust or light
                            foreign objects (like loose husks), which will
                            float to the surface. The water will become
                            cloudy. Drain this water. You don’t need a

                            of our dishes, and often even a mere tablespoon is enough to provide succulence.

                            flame associated with birth, marriage, and death. Ghee evolved when there was no
                            refrigeration (actually, many Indians still don’t have refrigerators today). Milk solids
                            and water promote rancidity in butter, and when they are removed, gone is the need
                            for a refrigerator. Middle Eastern and Arabic samneh is made the same way as ghee,

                            where more than a billion people exist, it seems a bit unfair that there is only one
                            cheese (and it’s the nonmelting kind). Who said life is fair? What’s fair is that this
                            cheese can also be purchased in the cheese section of some high-end supermarkets. Cut
                            up, it’s great in stir-fries, stews, or even crumbled over salads. Extra-firm tofu (drained
                            before use) is a great stand-in for paneer. The vegan at your table will appreciate that.

                            socks off. All you need is a spice grinder (a coffee grinder reserved for spices is the
                            answer) and a few ingredients purchased from your neighborhood grocery store to
                            make this mellifluous medley that packs a punch in every recipe it touches. But, if you
                            don’t have two minutes to put this together, by all means use a store-bought Madras-
                            style curry powder as an alternative. (Yes, I am opinionated, can you tell?)
                                The recipes that use this blend often instruct you to add it when you are stir-
                            frying something. If you were to sprinkle the ground mélange directly into hot oil or
                            a preheated naked skillet, it would yield burnt flavors and unappealing aromas. The
                            cushion that vegetables provide is essential to safeguard the blend from burning on
                            contact with the heat. This is not a masala (blend) that you can add as a finishing mix
                            (see Garam Masala, page 41) since the spices need to cook for a smoother quality.

                              iconic representation of Indian cuisine (garam means “warm” and masala means
                              “blend”). Cooks sprinkle a dash of this into every dish they want to taste “Indian.” It’s

                            dishes. Garam masalas are usually found in the north of India, and they are as diverse
                            as the regions they represent. In the myriad Indian versions the spices are left whole,
                            toasted, roasted, or ground to create blends that span a rainbow of flavors.

                            from scratch), keep in mind it will have to be added in the early stages of a recipe to
                            make sure the spices cook to yield a more refined cornucopia of tastes.

                            tested it on him, his big eyes became wider, and with that sheepish grin, he asked me
                            how I could possibly come up with something so good. I knew I had a winner. He did

                            much cayenne (yet ask for more heat), you certainly should be able to.

                            ingredients common to the north and the south (India, that is). Toasting whole spices,

                            while invigorating, perfumed mint, a hallmark ingredient in the north, provides a
                            calming balance, especially in the presence of plain yogurt.

                            because the chemical papain, a natural tenderizer present in the fruit, breaks down

                            unnecessary. The roast is often served in India with cilantro, slivers of raw red onions,
                            and wedges of lime and with tandoor-cooked naan alongside. You may wish to do the

                               trip to the fish market in Calcutta in the morning reveals bountiful fish and

                               sauntering from vendor to vendor in hopes of a morsel of sardine or any fish parts is
                            cute to see, as his begging eyes and pitiful meows pull at many a vendor’s heartstrings.
                            The perfect balance of simple spices here yields creamy results for sweet scallops,
                            and the combination is nothing short of perfection. Serve it with steamed white rice

                        I AM THE first to admit I am not a very sweet person. What I meant to say was I am very nice
                        but don’t have a sweet tooth. If I have the choice between a third helping of something savory
                        and a dessert, I’m likely to skip the sweets. Except when it comes to chocolate! Most of the
                        desserts in India are milk-based, relying on a ton of sugar and often one or two spices, namely
                        cardamom and saffron. They are perfectly delicious and do take care of the old Indian grand-
                        ma’s adage “Eat lots of sweets in the hope of saying sweet things.” My desire in offering the

                               saffron and speckled with decadent pistachios, this is what ice cream should be
                               all about. Smooth, opulent, sinful, but not as fat-laden as one might think, the ice
                            cream draws its intense flavors from a simple technique of condensing the milk. This
                            enriches the milk solids, and the film of cream that comes from boiling whole milk
                            provides texture, an integral mouthfeel, to the succulence of kulfi. Stick a wooden
                            stirrer into the ice cream as it freezes and you have what every child and childlike
                            adult cannot resist—an ice cream bar to lick until the cows come home (or until you
                            come home to the cows).
